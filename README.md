# CSC311-Project
Intro to Machine Learning Course Project, where we built machine learning algorithms to predict whether a student can correctly
answer a specific diagnostic question based on the student’s previous answers to other questions and other students’ responses.

In part a we explored models such as K Nearest Neighbors, Item Response Theory, and Auto Encoders, as well as the effect of Ensemble technique.

In part b we improved model performance by extending Item Response Theory (IRT) to consider student demographics.
