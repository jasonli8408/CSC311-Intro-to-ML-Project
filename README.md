# CSC311-Project
Intro to Machine Learning Course Project, where we built machine learning algorithms to predict whether a student can correctly
answer a specific diagnostic question based on the student’s previous answers to other questions and other students’ responses.

In part b we extended Item Response Theory (IRT) to improve model performance.
